# LISA-ProjectH419

This repository is a computing project as part of the first master year at the polytechnic school of Brussels (EPB).

The chosen project is : Biomedical engineering project in image analysis. [PROJ-H-419]
The goals of this project are:
- To understand the basic principles of image analysis and processing in the context of machine learning.
- To learn to manipulate some machine learning technology.
- To apply these principles to a concrete problem based on some kaggle competition.
- (optional) To search a certain field of application of machine learning in the context of biomedical engineering.
- To do a state of the art on the technology chosen.


For this project, I've mainly chosen to work with PyTorch, a machine learning library for Python mainly
focusing on Neural Network.

I've followed two tutorials in other to familiarize myself with Pytorch, the first one mainly for image recognition
simply using torch and the second one for sound recognition using torchaudio:

For the kaggle competition, I've chosen to work on ... (to be completed)
